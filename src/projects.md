## Project Sunroof (Google)

**Project Sunroof** ([google.com/sunroof](https://www.google.com/get/sunroof)) is a free, public tool for estimating the amount of renewable electricity that a home — or an entire city — could generate with solar panels. Project Sunroof uses machine learning to find feasible locations for solar panels on a roof. Then, the tool estimates electrical generation using historical weather, shadows from trees and obstacles, and locally applicable tax incentives.

The online [data explorer](https://www.google.com/get/sunroof/data-explorer/) provides solar overviews for many cities in the U.S., and the [homeowner tool](https://www.google.com/get/sunroof) allows individual residents to look up expected savings or costs for their address.

**GL Transmission Format (glTF)** ([khronos.org/gltf](https://www.khronos.org/gltf/)) is a royalty-free specification for the efficient transmission and loading of 3D scenes and models by applications. glTF minimizes both the size of 3D assets, and the runtime processing needed to unpack and use those assets. glTF defines an extensible, common publishing format for 3D content tools and services that streamlines authoring workflows and enables interoperable use of content across the industry.
