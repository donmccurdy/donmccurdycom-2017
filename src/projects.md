**Project Sunroof** ([google.com/sunroof](https://www.google.com/get/sunroof)) is a free, public tool for estimating the amount of renewable electricity that a home — or an entire city — could generate with solar panels. Project Sunroof uses machine learning to find feasible locations for solar panels on a roof. Then, the tool estimates electrical generation using historical weather, shadows from trees and obstacles, and locally applicable tax incentives.

The online [data explorer](https://www.google.com/get/sunroof/data-explorer/) provides solar overviews for many cities in the U.S., and the [homeowner tool](https://www.google.com/get/sunroof) allows individual residents to look up expected savings or costs for their address.
