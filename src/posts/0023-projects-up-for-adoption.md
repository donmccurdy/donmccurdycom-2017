I've spent some time unsure what to do with a couple of my older projects, [A-Frame Extras](https://github.com/donmccurdy-up-for-adoption/aframe-extras) and [A-Frame Physics System](https://github.com/donmccurdy-up-for-adoption/aframe-physics-system), and finally decided it's time to step back from developing both. They're each modestly popular projects, and I love seeing what people are building with them, but I haven't been dedicating the time that either project requires — even for maintenance — recently.

Both repositories are up for adoption<sup>[1](#footnote-1)</sup> under the [donmccurdy-up-for-adoption](https://github.com/donmccurdy-up-for-adoption) account. I prefer this to archiving them as I've done with more outdated projects: there are still plenty of active users here, and I'd be glad to see them continue. If you're interested in maintaining either project yourself or with others, please reach out with a GitHub issue.  Until (and unless) someone else takes over, both will be unmaintained indefinitely.

I have a few personal and practical reasons for this decision:

1. **I don't have a Facebook account**, and I don't plan on creating one. With recent announcements, I have limited time before [Facebook disables my Oculus Quest](https://www.oculus.com/blog/a-single-way-to-log-into-oculus-and-unlock-social-features/) and I lose the ability to develop and test with my own VR hardware.
2. **Bug fixes for WebXR projects are unusually time-consuming.** In a traditional software library, a public API can be unit tested, providing some confidence that a new change works correctly. With WebXR interaction and physics simulation, I haven't found a real alternative to manually testing on lots of devices. Perhaps there's a better way to automate testing for this type of project, but that's not something I'm personally excited to spend time inventing.
3. **Limited time / other interests.** The free time I'm willing to spend on OSS is finite — it isn't a day job and probably won't become one. I don't want to give the impression that these projects are actively supported when they're not, while leaving issues and PRs unanswered.

I will continue working on other things, building out [glTF-Transform](https://github.com/donmccurdy/glTF-Transform) and contributing to [three.js](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js) and [glTF](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF). I'm also taking online classes in probability and statistics, and generally trying to do the best I can with an unusually challenging year.
