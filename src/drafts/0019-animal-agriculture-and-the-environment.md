I'm vegetarian, in part for environmental reasons. As a result I sometimes hear arguments like these:

1. “grazing animals are good for grassland biodiversity”
2. “ruminants convert grains humans can't eat into calories that we can”
3. “meat production can be sustainable”

Each of those statements is true. But what people actually mean when saying any one of these is usually, “meat consumption has nothing to do with sustainability, and it isn't a problem.” That claim is demonstrably false, at least in the U.S., and it's worth digging into.

This is not a blog post meant to persuade anyone against eating meat. Individual dietary choices do have more impact than plastic bags and light bulbs, but ultimately individual choices aren't enough. The externalized costs of food are built into our food system, policies, and subsidies. The wrong choices are the defaults, and that needs to change. This post is simply a handful of facts with authoritative sources, meant to give a better understanding of agriculture and its effect on climate.

Livestock accounts for 18% of annual greenhouse gas emissions,<sup>[1](#footnote-1)</sup> more than the transport sector. If it's hard to picture cattle on a grassy field being such a bad thing, consider another image – 80% of meat production occurs in concentrated animal feeding operations (CAFOs),<sup>[2](#footnote-2)</sup> with little claim to promoting grassland biodiversity. That number is rising.<sup>[2.5](#footnote-2-5)</sup> Already, 33% of cropland is used to produce feed for livestock, and not for grazing.<sup>[3](#footnote-3)</sup>

The U.S. government spends $38 billion each year on subsidies for the meat and dairy industries, and only $0.017 billion on subsidies for fruit and vegetables.<sup>[4](#footnote-4)</sup> While beef consumption is down in the U.S. since the 1970s, it remains four times higher than the world average,<sup>[5](#footnote-5)</sup> and beef is the single most environmentally costly thing we eat.

~~Corporations like Tyson Foods are not unlike oil conglomerates, in that way, nor in their lobbying.~~

No one is saying that an environmentally-friendly steak isn’t possible (it is), or that preventing climate change requires that we give up meat entirely (it doesn't). We need to eat less meat. This basic fact is supported authoritative sources:

<br/>

> “<mark>The livestock sector emerges as one of the top two or three most significant contributors to the most serious environmental problems</mark>, at every scale from local to global. The findings of this report suggest that it should be a major policy focus when dealing with problems of land degradation, climate change and air pollution, water shortage and water pollution and loss of biodiversity.”

> <cite>UN Food and Agriculture Organization, “Livestock's Long Shadow: Environmental Issues and Options”, 2006</cite>.

<br/>

> “At present, higher incomes and increasing urbanization leads people to eat less grains and more meat, dairy, fish, fruit, and vegetables. This ‘Western’ diet uses far more scarce resources: like land and water and produces more GHG emissions. And the amount of food wasted by consumers in industrialized countries is enormous – quite possibly as much 25 per cent. An unprecedented shift to more sustainable eating trends must take place in both industrialized and emerging economies. <mark>We are not advocating ‘vegetarianism’, but it is clear that the overall amount of red meat consumed in many rich countries, for instance, needs to be lower</mark>.”

> <cite>Oxfam International</cite>.

<br/>

> “The potential for reducing GHG emissions from agriculture through changes in consumption could be substantially higher than technical mitigation options. Approaches include reducing food waste, changing diets towards less GHG-intensive food (e.g. substitution of animal products with plant-based food)”
>
> <cite>UNFCC (citation needed)</cite>.

<br/>

> “Our analysis suggests that staying within the planetary boundaries of the food system requires a combination of measures: <mark>GHG emissions cannot be sufficiently mitigated without dietary changes towards more plant-based diets</mark>.”
>
> <cite>University of Oxford / Nature Magazine</cite>.

<br/>

> “...shifting to diets with a greater share of <mark>plant-based foods could significantly reduce agriculture’s pressure on the environment</mark>.”
>
> <cite>World Resources Institute, “Shifting Diets for a Sustainable Food Future”, April 2016</cite>.

<br/>

> “We must be aware that our food choices ultimately impact more than just ourselves, and <mark>primarily plant-based diets are best for both health outcomes and the environment</mark>.”

If you hear someone saying that meat consumption has nothing to do with climate change, ask for sources. Current meat consumption in the U.S. is incompatible with preventing catastrophic climate change over the next hundred years.
