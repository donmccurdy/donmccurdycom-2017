As a vegetarian, I occasionally hear arguments like these when faced with questions about meat consumption and the environment:

1. “grazing animals are good for grassland biodiversity”
2. “ruminants convert grains humans can't eat into calories that we can”
3. “meat production can be sustainable”

Each of those statements is true. But what people actually mean when saying any one of these is often, “meat consumption has nothing to do with climate change.” That claim is unambiguously false.

Livestock accounts for 18% of annual greenhouse gas emissions,<sup>[1](#footnote-1)</sup> more than the transport sector, putting corporations like Tyson Foods squarely in the company of oil conglomerates. If it's hard to picture cattle on a grassy field being such a bad thing, that's because it's an inaccurate picture – 80% of meat production now occurs in concentrated animal feeding operations (CAFOs),<sup>[2](#footnote-2)</sup> with no credible claim to promoting grassland biodiversity. Globally, 33% of cropland is used to produce feed for livestock, and not for grazing, ~~while livesock provides 25% of protein intake and 15% of dietary energy~~.<sup>[3](#footnote-3)</sup>

I'm not writing this blog post to persuade anyone not to eat meat – it's clear that climate change cannot be addressed by individual choices like avoiding plastic straws or carrying a tote bag. What's necessary, instead, is that voters and policymakers understand the unpriced, externalized costs of how meat is actually produced today, ~~and how to change that~~.

The U.S. government spends $38 billion each year on subsidies for the meat and dairy industries, and only $0.017 billion on subsidies for fruit and vegetables.<sup>[4](#footnote-4)</sup> While beef consumption is down in the U.S. since the 1970s, it remains four times higher than the world average,<sup>[5](#footnote-5)</sup> and is the single the most environmentally costly thing we eat.

~~Worse, these subsidies can cause other countries – which do not share America's historically high meat consumption – to follow our lead.~~

No one is saying that an environmentally-friendly steak isn’t possible (it is), or that preventing climate change requires that we give up meat entirely. That isn’t the point –

We need to eat less meat. That basic fact is supported unambiguously by credible sources:

> “...shifting to diets with a greater share of plant-based foods could significantly reduce agriculture’s pressure on the environment.”

~ World Resources Institute, “Shifting Diets for a Sustainable Food Future”, April 2016.

> “<mark>The livestock sector emerges as one of the top two or three most significant contributors to the most serious environmental problems</mark>, at every scale from local to global. The findings of this report suggest that it should be a major policy focus when dealing with problems of land degradation, climate change and air pollution, water shortage and water pollution and loss of biodiversity.”

~ UN Food and Agriculture Organization, “Livestock's Long Shadow: Environmental Issues and Options”, 2006.

> “The potential for reducing GHG emissions from agriculture through changes in consumption could be substantially higher than technical mitigation options. Approaches include reducing food waste, changing diets towards less GHG-intensive food (e.g. substitution of animal products with plant-based food)”

~ UNFCC (citation needed).

> “Our analysis suggests that staying within the planetary boundaries of the food system requires a combination of measures: <mark>GHG emissions cannot be sufficiently mitigated without dietary changes towards more plant-based diets</mark>.”

~ University of Oxford / Nature Magazine.

> “We must be aware that our food choices ultimately impact more than just ourselves, and <mark>primarily plant-based diets are best for both health outcomes and the environment</mark>.”

~ Harvard University.

> “At present, higher incomes and increasing urbanization leads people to eat less grains and more meat, dairy, fish, fruit, and vegetables. This ‘Western’ diet uses far more scarce resources: like land and water and produces more GHG emissions. And the amount of food wasted by consumers in industrialized countries is enormous – quite possibly as much 25 per cent. An unprecedented shift to more sustainable eating trends must take place in both industrialized and emerging economies. <mark>We are not advocating ‘vegetarianism’, but it is clear that the overall amount of red meat consumed in many rich countries, for instance, needs to be lower</mark>.”

~ Oxfam International.

If you hear someone saying that meat consumption has nothing to do with climate change, ask for sources. Current Western meat consumption – or worse, Indian or Chinese adoption of those habits – is incompatible with preventing catastrophic climate change over the next hundred years.

~~TODO: Mention Chinese goals?~~
